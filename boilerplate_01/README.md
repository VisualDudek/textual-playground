Prompt: write me boilerplate code app for python textual framework, provide hevy comment to explain what is going on in context of textual faramework

To tailor the boilerplate code best for your needs, could you clarify a few things?

1. Should the app be a simple single-screen interface, or should it include navigation between multiple views?
2. Would you like a basic layout with widgets like buttons, input fields, or tables?
3. Are you targeting a TUI dashboard, form interface, log viewer, or something else?

Once I have this, I can generate a well-commented boilerplate tailored to that use case.
